Plots:
 * **AF_arranged_plot.png:** Plot of polarized allele frequencies across sampling sites (outlier loci and non-outlier loci). Created with `Allele Freqs Line Plots.R`.
 * **BF_correlation_plots_mac2.png:** Scatterplots of BFs for every combination of environmental variables. Created with `BF Correlation Plots.R`.
 * **BF_outlier_plots_mac2.png:** Scatterplots of XtX v. BFs for each environmental variable. Created with `BF Correlation Plots.R`.
 * **BF_permuted_distribution_plots_mac2.png:** ECDFs of BFs for experimental data and permuted data for each environmental variable. Created with `ECDFs for Sim v Real BFs.R`.
 * **Fst_boxplot_mac2.png:** Boxplot of per-locus Fsts, separated by outlier status. Created with `Fst_script.R`.
 * **Fst_plot_mac2.png:** "Manhattan plot" of per-locus Fsts. Color-coded by outlier status. X-axis ordered by contig # (not necessarily place in genome). Created with `Fst_script.R.`.
 * **PCA_mac2.png:** PCAs generated with different sets of loci (all loci, loci in HWE, outlier loci only, no outlier loci). Created with `PCAs.R`.
 * **mac2_K_plot.png:** STRUCTURE plots generated with different sets of loci (all loci, loci in HWE, outlier loci only, no outlier loci). Created with `STRUCTURE_script.R`.
 * **TajimasD_all_mac1_SYN.png** & **TajimasD_outliersonly_mac1_SYN.png:** Scatterplots of Tajima's D for either all contigs or outlier only contigs (outlier = contig with at least one outlier locus). Color-coded by sampling site. Created with `TajimaD_script.R`.
 * **TajimasD_boxplot_mac1_SYN.png:** Boxplot of Tajima's D for each sampling site and for all sampling sites pooled. Color-coded by outlier status. Created with `TajimaD_script.R`.

 * **TD_pi_plot.png:** Scatterplots of Tajima's D v. pi for each sampling site, for all sampling sites pooled, and for outlier contigs only.Color-coded by outlier status (outlier contigs only is color-coded by sampling site). Created by `TD_v_pi.R`.
 * **pi_boxplot_mac2.png:** Boxplot of pi for each sampling site and for all sampling sites pooled. Color-coded by outlier status. Created by `pi.R`.
 * **pi_plot_mac2.png:** Average pi in each sampling site with 95% CIs. Created by `pi.R`.
 * **sampling_distribution_map.jpeg:** Map of sampling sites and range extent of *A. clarkii*. Red shading indicates the relative probability of occurrence of *A. clarkii*. Created with arcGIS.
 * **wang_relatedness_95CI_mac2.png:** Average within-site pair-wise relatedness in each sampling site with 95% CIs. created by `relatedness.R`.
